[**Direct Download**][dl-latest]

As F1 pulls up to the Belgian Grand Prix, the Minecraft Ice Boat Racing series follows! This is a recreation of the circuit Spa Francorchamps with various fantasy elements to make for a good ice boat racing map.

Big thanks to MosquitoFRA for creating the basis of this map.
